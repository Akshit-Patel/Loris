Create Timepoint Test Plan:

1. Access a candidate that does not have all timepoints from project created from Access Profile and click "Create time point"
2. Choose a subproject from dropdown. Ensure that page reloads with subproject selected and also a list of visit labels
3. Click create time point without choosing visit. Ensure there's an error.
4. Choose visit label to be created and click "Create Time Point". Ensure that you get a page saying creation was successful. Click on "Click here to continue" link and ensure that it brings you back to timepoint list page for that candidate (with new timepoint created)
