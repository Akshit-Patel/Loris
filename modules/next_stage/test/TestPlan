1. Create a new candidate and create new timepoint for them.
2. Click "Start Visit Stage" on left of instrument_list ensure that page renders.
3. Ensure that you get an error if dates do not match.
4. Ensure that you get an error if scan_done missing
5. Create a timepoint where the age (date entered minus DoB) falls within the AgeMin and AgeMax for a test_battery. Ensure that those instruments are inserted (for the correct subprojectID).
6. Create a timepoint where there is a test_battery entry for the Visit_label and start the stage. Ensure that those were inserted into the battery, and NOT the ones based on age.
7. Ensure that any instruments in test_battery with firstVisit='Y' where inserted if and only if it's the first timepoint started. Ensure that firstVisit='N' instruments are inserted if and only if it is NOT the first timepoint started, and firstVisit=null whether or not it's the first time point.
8. Ensure that if a CenterID is set for a row in the test battery, the instrument is inserted for candidates at that centerID (if Visit_label or Age are correct.), and not other centers
