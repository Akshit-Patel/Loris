2. Check that the instruments combo box contains all the instrument names.
3. Perform various searches and validate the results. Use any combination of the available search criteria. Make sure that when performing a keyword search the alrorithm take column Name, SourceField and Description into account.
4. Check that the table can be sorted according to any column, except column 'No'.
5. Check that pushing the Clear button sets the Description search field to 'All', the Instruments search field to 'All instruments', clears the search keyword text field and performs a search with these criteria. Validate the results.
